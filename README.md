# Hermes
A continuation of ALP, but way better.

The program will guide you through usage, two things to know though:

Hermes' input system is very rudamentary, so sentences have to be entered one word at a time. When a fullstop (period for you yanks) is reached the sentence is ended and sent to Hermes to process.

Quitting is done like it is in VIM, so type ":q" and hit enter, and Hermes will close.

Before running Hermes you must create 5 blank txt files named "dictionary.txt", "netx.txt", "nety.txt", "nodes.txt" and "synapses.txt". Make sure you also have at least 2 GB of space on your system, synapses.txt can be HUGE. You should also run the compiled "netgen.cpp" program to generate a neural net before Hermes is ran.
