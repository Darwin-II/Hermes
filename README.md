# Hermes
A continuation of ALP, but way better.

The program will guide you through usage, two things to know though:

Hermes' input system is very rudamentary, so sentences have to be entered one word at a time. When a fullstop (period for you yanks) is reached the sentence is ended and sent to Hermes to process.

Quitting is done like it is in VIM, so type ":q" and hit enter, and Hermes will close.

After further testing it will not startup without a file named "dictionary.txt" being placed in the same directory as it.
